The circuit works by taking input from push button as a switch and controls power between servo1 and servo2 based on the push button input. Along with that, one of the potentiometer attached to the circuit is used to control position of motor by mapping the potentiometer value to the servo motor's angle. Another servo motor, adjusts the brightness of the LCD display. The LCD display has various pins which are appropriately connected to the arduino pins and breadboard.
