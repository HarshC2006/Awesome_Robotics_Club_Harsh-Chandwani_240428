Stair Climbing Robot


For this robot, I would use tracked wheels as the mechanism for stair climbing. Tracked wheels are highly effective for this purpose as they provide strong traction and maintain consistent contact with the surface of the stairs which would provide better grip and reducing risk of slipping. Tracked wheels provide increased surface contact which would also result in more evenly distribution of robot's weight than other wheel systems. 
In addition to performance benefits, tracked systems offer a mechanically simpler design by eliminating the need for additional degrees of freedom and complex structures often found in legged or hybrid robots. This reduced chances of potential failure and increased reliability.

The robot is designed to have a low and wide base, which enhances stability by lowering center of mass and helps to distribute the robot's weight more evenly. On top of that, heavy components like batteries, motor drivers etc. are placed low to the ground and central to the robot to further ensure ,a lower center of mass, and minimizing the risk of robot tilting to any particular side. 

The robot requires four high-powered brushed DC motors to drive the tracks. Tracked wheels maintain more contact than other wheels to move and because it is basically sliding over the stairs, so it would need to overcome greater amount of friction to move, so the requirements for battery packs would also be high. Number of batteries or amount of battery power can be calculated by observing its speed and power generated by motor drivers.

This robot relies on IMU and IR sensors to efficiently climb stairs. The IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) provides real-time data on the robot’s orientation, which is crucial for maintaining balance throughout the climbing process. By setting specific tilt thresholds based on the robot’s mechanical limits, the system can determine how much inclination it can safely handle. If the robot approaches or exceeds these thresholds, corrective actions can be taken to prevent tipping or instability. Infrared sensors are added in front of the robot to detect the edge of stairs and identify other obstacles that might hinder movement. To get more vision to avoid obstacles, various depth sensors or computer vision techniques can be used to achieve the task.

Control logics like when IR sensor detects a vertical surface, the robot should adjust to climbing mode, providing more power to motor drivers. when IMU sensor detects a orientation beyond the given threshold, the robot can be sped up or down to prevent slipping.
